  It's official, PMO's do scream loudest. I'm confident that I'm the most
  qualified person in the world to confirm this, because I've tested it about 50
  times. Before my conference talks / performances I like to oxygenate the
  audience a little bit, get them a bit pumped up, do something a bit different
  and get those brain juices flowing.
