Business dynamics have been changing in the Egyptian market over the past few years and with these changes it became clear that many firms; specially small / medium sized & family businesses lack the capabilities and the necessary resources to reach their strategic goals and healthy growth objectives.

It was clear that there were needs for "know how" to transform, enhance, develop and implement new approach to solve business constraints with new better proven methods to look at the customer with low cost model to outsource program / project activities in most essential business strategic needs, and to comply with Projectized.co initiatives.

Our services are based on Project Management Office (PMO) Model. This model is usually adopted inside PROJECTIZED or STRONG MATRIX organizations types. Projectized.co saw the opportunity to implement the PMO model as it's own internal structure and act as a virtual PMO providing project services solution to cater for our customer's needs taking advantage of our talented PM's at PROJECTIZED.CO.
